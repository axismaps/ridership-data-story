        <p>Ridership at most transit agencies has declined in recent years, with important exceptions. Operational,
          service, and demographic characteristics help explain how and why ridership outcomes are different at Houston
          Metro, Maryland’s MTA, LA Metro, Seattle’s King County Metro, WMATA in DC and DART in Dallas.</p>

        <p>Bus ridership has grown in King County and Houston, where recent bus network redesigns improved route
          connections to rail, service frequency, and slow zones. Most agencies haven’t updated bus networks (and bus
          trips continue to drop). And a network redesign must be carefully implemented and may take time to show
          results; Maryland’s MTA redesigned a network in 2017 but has not grown bus ridership yet.</p>

        <p>In 2016, residents of LA County and King County voted to expand agency funding through taxes. Operating

          done by building new rail lines since 2012.<br><br>In DC, WMATA has not substantially expanded or redesigned
          bus or rail service, and ridership has suffered on both.</p>

        <p>And service must go through high-density areas so that many people can get to many destinations. DART’s
          paltry rail ridership growth compared to Houston Metro’s reflects rail placement in relatively low-density and
          low-growth areas.</p>

        <p>Demographic change also impacts transit ridership. In Portland, higher-income people have moved to
          transit-served neighborhoods, pushing lower-income people, who are more frequent transit riders, farther from
          transit.</p>
